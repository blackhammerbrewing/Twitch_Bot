# Twitch_Bot
Open Source Twitch Bot for community driven events developed for Black Hammer
Brewing in San Francisco, CA. 

The bot works bu connecting to a live twitch chat and responding to user input.
This allows the community to interact with the stream and the streamers to
interact with the community in a seemless way.
